# 🌟 Vedic Astro AI

> **Ancient Calculations. AI‑Assisted Interpretation.**
> A full‑stack experimental Vedic Astrology application that focuses on **accurate chart calculation** and **AI‑generated explanations**.

## ⚠️ Important Note (Honest Scope)

This project is **not built by an astrologer**.

* All astrological logic, calculations, and code structure are **fully written using Google Gemini (gemini‑3‑pro)**.
* My role is **engineering, integration, and validation**, not astrological authorship.
* The AI **does not calculate astrology** — it only **interprets already‑calculated results**.

This project should be viewed as:

> **An AI‑assisted Vedic astrology software experiment**

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Chart Calculation (Core Focus)**
  Uses **Swiss Ephemeris (C‑Kernel)** with **Lahiri Ayanamsa**, validated by comparing results with **JHora** for consistency.

* **North Indian Chart Rendering**
  Custom React‑based SVG logic to display a **North Indian (Diamond‑style) Kundli**.

* **AI‑Generated Explanations**
  Google Gemini analyzes:

  * Planetary placements
  * Houses and signs
  * Vimshottari Dasha timeline and converts them into **readable natural‑language insights**.

* **Vimshottari Dasha (Algorithmic)**
  Programmatic calculation of the 120‑year dasha cycle down to **Antardasha** level.

* **Geo‑Location Handling**
  City‑based location lookup with automatic latitude, longitude, and timezone resolution.
